## Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python

MIT offers archived versions of some of their classes online. I initially took this class on my own and when I was 3/4 of the way
complete I decided to take the UMBC Extension School's "Foundations of Software Development" course which focused on Python. 
Both classes were similar and had similar challenges and lessons although the MIT course had a bit more mathematics. 

The original MIT class I took was the 2016 offering of this class which can be found here:
- https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/

I've decided to retake the course and refresh my Python skills with the newer 2022 version which can be found here:
- https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-100l-introduction-to-cs-and-programming-using-python-fall-2022/ 

This repository is for two things: 
1. storing all things related to the class 
2. learning how to make use of an IDE in conjunction with GitHub
